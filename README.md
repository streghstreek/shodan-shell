# Hacking Jenkins using Shodan API  

## Requirements: 
0. Works on any platform
1. PHP
2. Shodan API Key 
3. PHP Curl  
  
## Usage      
   
I have created 2 scripts for hacking jenkins in much easier way.
 
### Hacking jenkins involves 2 steps:
1. Execute **shodan.php** to get the list of all vulnerable jenkins URLs and on which user the jenkins is running 
2. To execute shell commands on jenkins server, run **jenkins-cli.php**. This script will take care of the exploits. Just sit back and do whatever you want on shell

### Note : To get the shell, jenkins has to be running on linux server
